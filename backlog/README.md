# GoCommender Backlog - Task Management

This directory contains individual task files for the GoCommender project. Each task's status is encoded in its filename.

**Naming Convention:**
`[task-id]-[short-description]--[status].md`

- `[task-id]`: A numerical prefix (e.g., `01`, `02`) used for ordering and unique identification.
- `[short-description]`: A concise, hyphen-separated description of the task.
- `[status]`: The current status of the task.

**Task Statuses:**

- **`--todo` (or no suffix):** The task is identified and ready to be started. Files without a status suffix are implicitly `--todo`.
- **`--in-progress`:** The LLM is currently working on this task.
- **`--blocked`:** The task cannot proceed because it's waiting for external input.
- **`--review`:** The LLM has completed its work, but human review or approval is required.
- **`--done`:** The task is fully finished and verified.
- **`--skipped` / `--cancelled`:** The task has been explicitly decided not to be implemented.

## Project Status: ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETE

All 14 planned implementation steps have been successfully completed! The GoCommender project is production-ready with:

**âœ… Complete Implementation:**
- Core backend services and data models
- External API integrations (MusicBrainz, Discogs, Last.fm)
- Caching layer with SQLite persistence
- Plex integration for music library access
- LLM client for OpenAI recommendations
- Full HTTP API with CORS support
- TypeScript frontend with Vite
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Docker containerization and deployment
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Data-centric design** with MusicBrainz ID as universal identifier
- **Graceful degradation** for optional API services
- **Rate-limited clients** respecting external API limits
- **JSON-based SQLite storage** for complex Go types
- **Zero-framework frontend** with type-safe TypeScript

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Verify current build status
task build                    # Should pass (all tests + lint + build)

# Development workflow
task dev                      # Backend development server (:8080)
task frontend-dev             # Frontend with hot-reload (:5173)

# End-to-end testing
./build/test-recommendations -playlist="My Favorites" -count=3 -verbose

# Deployment
docker-compose up -d          # Full-stack deployment
```

## Next Steps for Future Development

Since all planned tasks are complete, future work might include:

1. **Performance optimizations** - Caching improvements, concurrent processing
2. **Additional music services** - Spotify, Apple Music, etc.
3. **Advanced ML features** - Custom recommendation models
4. **Mobile applications** - Native iOS/Android clients
5. **Social features** - Sharing recommendations, user profiles

## LLM Workflow for New Tasks

1. **Discover Tasks**: Use `LS` or `Glob` on `@backlog/` to review task files
2. **Prioritize**: Focus on files with `--todo` or `--in-progress` status
3. **Start Task**: Rename file to `--in-progress` when beginning work
4. **Execute Task**: Follow instructions within the task file
5. **Complete Task**: Rename to `--done` upon successful completion and verification
6. **Handle Blocks**: Rename to `--blocked` if external input is needed

## Technical Foundation

The project follows a **data-centric architecture** with these key patterns:

- **Universal Identifier**: MusicBrainz ID (MBID) as primary key across all services
- **Database Compatibility**: Custom Go types implement `database/sql/driver` for SQLite JSON storage
- **Rate-Limited Clients**: All external APIs use proper rate limiting and retry logic
- **Configuration Management**: Viper with environment variable precedence
- **Frontend Architecture**: Component-based TypeScript with functional patterns

All implementation details and verification steps are documented in the individual task files.
