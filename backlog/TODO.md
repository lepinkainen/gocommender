  - [x] Test utilities and fixtures

**üöß CURRENT FOCUS (Step 12)**

- [ ] **Deployment Preparation** - Next to implement
  - [ ] Docker containerization
  - [ ] Environment configuration
  - [ ] Production setup

**üìã REMAINING WORK (Steps 12-13)**

- [ ] **12** - Deployment Preparation (Docker, environment setup)
- [ ] **13** - Container Publishing (CI/CD, registry)

## Architecture Status

**‚úÖ Foundation Complete**

- Core `Artist` model with MBID as primary key
- Database schema with JSON column support
- Configuration loading with environment variables
- MusicBrainz client with rate limiting and data transformation
- External API clients (Discogs, Last.fm) with enrichment service
- Caching layer with SQLite persistence and TTL management
- Plex integration for music library access and track extraction
- LLM client for OpenAI integration and recommendations
- Recommendation engine orchestration service
- End-to-end testing command with CLI interface

**üîÑ Current Implementation Layer**

- HTTP API endpoints for web interface

**‚è≥ Pending Layers**

- Production deployment and containerization

## Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Data Strategy**: MusicBrainz ID (MBID) as universal artist identifier
2. **Database**: SQLite with JSON columns for complex types (no CGO dependencies)
3. **Configuration**: Viper with environment variable precedence
4. **Rate Limiting**: Custom implementation per API (MusicBrainz: ~50 req/min)
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for optional APIs
6. **Dependencies**: Minimal approach using standard library where possible

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start Step 10**: Implement HTTP API endpoints (`internal/api/`)
2. **Follow with**: REST handlers for recommendations
3. **Then**: Complete web interface integration

## End-to-End Testing Ready! üéâ

You can now test the complete workflow from Plex to recommendations:

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export PLEX_URL="http://localhost:32400"
export PLEX_TOKEN="your-plex-token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"

# Optional API keys for better results
export DISCOGS_TOKEN="your-discogs-token"
export LASTFM_API_KEY="your-lastfm-key"

# Run end-to-end test
./build/test-recommendations -playlist="My Favorites" -count=3 -verbose
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Current state check
task build                    # Should pass (builds with external API integration)

# Function analysis
go run llm-shared/utils/gofuncs/gofuncs.go -dir .

# Next development
task dev                      # Run development server
```

## Notes

- All plan files in `plan/01-13_*.md` contain detailed implementation steps
- Each step includes verification commands and dependency chains
- Recommendation engine (Step 09) complete with full workflow orchestration
- **Ready for end-to-end testing!** The complete Plex ‚Üí OpenAI ‚Üí Enrichment ‚Üí Response workflow is functional
- CLI testing tool available: `./build/test-recommendations`
- Ready to proceed with HTTP API implementation
