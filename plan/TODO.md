# GoCommender Implementation Progress

## Quick Status Overview

**‚úÖ COMPLETED (Steps 01-07)**

- [x] Project setup and structure
- [x] Data models with SQLite compatibility
- [x] Configuration management with Viper
- [x] MusicBrainz API integration
- [x] **External APIs Integration**
  - [x] Discogs API client for artist descriptions and images
  - [x] Last.fm API client for additional metadata
  - [x] Multi-source artist enrichment service
- [x] **Caching Layer** 
  - [x] SQLite operations for artist persistence (`internal/db/artist.go`)
  - [x] TTL management and cache expiry (`internal/db/cache.go`)
  - [x] Background refresh mechanisms (`internal/db/refresh.go`)
- [x] **Plex Integration** - Complete
  - [x] XML API client for Plex server communication (`internal/services/plex.go`)
  - [x] Playlist parsing and track extraction
  - [x] Artist metadata extraction from Plex tracks

**üöß CURRENT FOCUS (Step 08)**

- [ ] **LLM Client** - Next to implement
  - [ ] OpenAI integration for recommendations

**üìã REMAINING WORK (Steps 09-13)**
- [ ] **09** - Recommendation Engine (orchestrate all services)
- [ ] **10** - HTTP API (REST endpoints, middleware, JSON responses)
- [ ] **11** - Testing Strategy (unit tests, integration tests)
- [ ] **12** - Deployment Preparation (Docker, environment setup)
- [ ] **13** - Container Publishing (CI/CD, registry)

## Architecture Status

**‚úÖ Foundation Complete**

- Core `Artist` model with MBID as primary key
- Database schema with JSON column support
- Configuration loading with environment variables
- MusicBrainz client with rate limiting and data transformation
- External API clients (Discogs, Last.fm) with enrichment service
- Caching layer with SQLite persistence and TTL management
- Plex integration for music library access and track extraction

**üîÑ Current Implementation Layer**

- LLM client for OpenAI integration and recommendations

**‚è≥ Pending Layers**

- Recommendation engine orchestration
- HTTP API and web interface

## Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Data Strategy**: MusicBrainz ID (MBID) as universal artist identifier
2. **Database**: SQLite with JSON columns for complex types (no CGO dependencies)
3. **Configuration**: Viper with environment variable precedence
4. **Rate Limiting**: Custom implementation per API (MusicBrainz: ~50 req/min)
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for optional APIs
6. **Dependencies**: Minimal approach using standard library where possible

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start Step 08**: Implement LLM client (`internal/services/llm.go`)
2. **Follow with**: OpenAI integration for recommendations
3. **Then**: Artist recommendation prompt engineering

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Current state check
task build                    # Should pass (builds with external API integration)

# Function analysis
go run llm-shared/utils/gofuncs/gofuncs.go -dir .

# Next development
task dev                      # Run development server
```

## Notes

- All plan files in `plan/01-13_*.md` contain detailed implementation steps
- Each step includes verification commands and dependency chains
- Plex integration (Step 07) complete with XML API client and track extraction
- Ready to proceed with LLM client implementation
