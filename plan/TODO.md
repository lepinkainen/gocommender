# GoCommender Implementation Progress

## Quick Status Overview

**‚úÖ COMPLETED (Steps 01-05)**
- [x] Project setup and structure
- [x] Data models with SQLite compatibility  
- [x] Configuration management with Viper
- [x] MusicBrainz API integration
- [x] **External APIs Integration**
  - [x] Discogs API client for artist descriptions and images
  - [x] Last.fm API client for additional metadata
  - [x] Multi-source artist enrichment service

**üöß CURRENT FOCUS (Step 06)**
- [ ] **Caching Layer** - Next to implement
  - [ ] SQLite operations for artist persistence
  - [ ] TTL management and cache expiry
  - [ ] Background refresh mechanisms

**üìã REMAINING WORK (Steps 07-13)**
- [ ] **07** - Plex Integration (XML API, playlist parsing, track extraction)  
- [ ] **08** - LLM Client (OpenAI integration for recommendations)
- [ ] **09** - Recommendation Engine (orchestrate all services)
- [ ] **10** - HTTP API (REST endpoints, middleware, JSON responses)
- [ ] **11** - Testing Strategy (unit tests, integration tests)
- [ ] **12** - Deployment Preparation (Docker, environment setup)
- [ ] **13** - Container Publishing (CI/CD, registry)

## Architecture Status

**‚úÖ Foundation Complete**
- Core `Artist` model with MBID as primary key
- Database schema with JSON column support  
- Configuration loading with environment variables
- MusicBrainz client with rate limiting and data transformation
- External API clients (Discogs, Last.fm) with enrichment service

**üîÑ Current Implementation Layer**
- Caching and persistence layer for artist data
- SQLite operations with TTL management

**‚è≥ Pending Layers**
- Plex library integration  
- LLM recommendation generation
- HTTP API and web interface

## Key Technical Decisions Made

1. **Data Strategy**: MusicBrainz ID (MBID) as universal artist identifier
2. **Database**: SQLite with JSON columns for complex types (no CGO dependencies)
3. **Configuration**: Viper with environment variable precedence
4. **Rate Limiting**: Custom implementation per API (MusicBrainz: ~50 req/min)
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for optional APIs
6. **Dependencies**: Minimal approach using standard library where possible

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Start Step 06**: Implement SQLite database operations (`internal/db/`)
2. **Follow with**: Artist persistence with caching logic
3. **Then**: TTL management and background refresh mechanisms

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Current state check
task build                    # Should pass (builds with external API integration)

# Function analysis  
go run llm-shared/utils/gofuncs/gofuncs.go -dir .

# Next development
task dev                      # Run development server
```

## Notes

- All plan files in `plan/01-13_*.md` contain detailed implementation steps
- Each step includes verification commands and dependency chains
- External API integration (Step 05) complete with comprehensive tests
- Ready to proceed with caching layer implementation
