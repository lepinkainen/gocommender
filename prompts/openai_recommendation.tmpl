# Music Discovery Task

I need artist recommendations for music discovery. You must suggest ONLY artists I don't already know.

## My High-Rated Tracks (Listening Profile):
{{range .SeedTracks}}- "{{.Title}}" by {{.Artist}} ({{.Year}}) {{.Stars}}
{{end}}{{if .HasMoreTracks}}... and {{sub .TotalTrackCount .SeedLimit}} more tracks
{{end}}
{{if .Genre}}## Genre Focus: {{.Genre}}
Please focus recommendations within this genre while maintaining style similarity.

{{end}}## CRITICAL: Artists to EXCLUDE (Already in My Collection):
DO NOT suggest ANY of these artists - they are already known to me:

{{range .PriorityArtists}}- {{.}}
{{end}}{{range .OtherArtists}}- {{.}}
{{end}}{{if .HasMoreArtists}}
(Showing {{.ExclusionLimit}} of {{.TotalKnownCount}} total known artists - please avoid ALL variations and similar names)
{{end}}
## Requirements:
1. Suggest exactly {{.MaxResults}} artists
2. Each artist must be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from my known artists
3. Artists must be real and have released official albums
4. Focus on stylistic similarity to my high-rated tracks
5. Double-check each suggestion against the exclusion list
6. If unsure about an artist, choose someone else

## Response Format (JSON only):
```json
{
  "suggestions": ["Artist 1", "Artist 2", "Artist 3", ...],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of recommendations",
  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

Remember: The goal is MUSIC DISCOVERY - I want to find NEW artists!
